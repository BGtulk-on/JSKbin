# Kbin ‚ú®

Kbin is a lightweight and flexible JavaScript library that makes animating elements on your webpage a breeze. With simple methods you can create smooth transitions, including sliding and fading effects, all with minimal code. üåü

## üöÄ Features

- **Smooth Transitions**: Animate elements with ease using `goTo` and `goFrom`.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Control the position (`x`, `y`), animation duration, opacity, and more.
- **Flexible Fade-In Effects**: With `goFrom`, you can make elements fade in and slide into view from any position.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works well on all modern browsers.

## üí° Methods

### `goTo(selector, options)`
Move selected elements to a specific position with smooth transitions.

#### Parameters:
- `selector`: The CSS selector of the element(s) to animate.
- `options`:
  - `x`: Horizontal translation (in pixels).
  - `y`: Vertical translation (in pixels).
  - `duration`: Duration of the transition (in seconds, default is `1`).

#### Example:
```javascript
kbin.goTo(".box", { x: 100, y: 50, duration: 2 });
```

### `goFrom(selector, options)`
Animate elements by moving them from an off-screen position while optionally fading them in.

#### Parameters:
- `selector`: The CSS selector of the element(s) to animate.
- `options`:
  - `x`: Starting horizontal position (in pixels, default is `50`).
  - `y`: Starting vertical position (in pixels, default is `0`).
  - `duration`: Duration of the transition (in seconds, default is `1.5`).
  - `delay`: Delay before the transition starts (in seconds, default is `0`).
  - `opacity`: Final opacity after transition (default is `1`).
  - `opacityChange`: If `true`, the element fades in (default is `true`).

#### Example:
```javascript
kbin.goFrom(".circle", { x: 100, y: 50, duration: 2, opacity: 1, opacityChange: true });
```

## üé® Customization

Kbin provides a variety of options for customizing animations:

- **Positioning**: Move elements in any direction with `x` and `y`.
- **Timing**: Adjust animation speed with `duration` and delay with `delay`.
- **Opacity**: Control fading effects with `opacity` and `opacityChange`.
